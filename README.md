## 📌 Problem Statement

E-commerce companies like Amazon, Flipkart, and Meesho lose **billions of rupees annually** due to product returns. High return rates lead to:

- 📦 Increased logistics & reverse-shipping costs
- 🏭 Inventory management problems
- 💸 Revenue loss and reduced profit margins
- 😟 Poor customer experience

**This project builds a Machine Learning model that predicts whether a product order will be returned — before it is shipped.** By identifying high-risk orders early, businesses can take proactive steps to reduce return rates.

---

## 🎯 Objective

> Predict the probability of a product being returned based on order features such as discount percentage, delivery time, payment method, product category, and customer behavior.

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Key findings from the analysis:

### 📦 Return Rate by Category
> Fashion leads with **42.4%** return rate, primarily due to wrong size/fit issues.

### 💸 Discount Effect
> Orders with **50%+ discount** have nearly **2x higher return rate** than low-discount orders.
> Heavy discounts encourage impulse buying, which leads to returns.

### 🚚 Delivery Days
> Return rate spikes significantly when delivery exceeds **7 days**.
> On-time delivery is strongly correlated with customer satisfaction.

### 💳 Payment Method
> **Cash on Delivery (COD)** orders show the **highest return rate** — customers feel less committed when paying later.

### 👤 Customer Type
> **New customers** return 6% more than loyal customers.
> Loyal customers show the lowest return rate.

### 🔥 Correlation Highlights
> `discount_percent` and `delivery_days` are the **strongest predictors** of product returns.

| New Feature | Logic |
|-------------|-------|
| `actual_price` | Price after applying discount |
| `high_discount` | 1 if discount ≥ 40% |
| `late_delivery` | 1 if delivery days > 5 |
| `low_seller_rating` | 1 if seller rating < 3.5 |
| `low_customer_rating` | 1 if customer rating ≤ 2 |
| `premium_product` | 1 if price > ₹10,000 |
| `order_month` | Month extracted from order date |
| `festival_season` | 1 if order placed in Oct–Dec |
| `is_cod` | 1 if payment method is Cash on Delivery |
